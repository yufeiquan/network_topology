Part 2


These part contains a topology file and a controller files bonusTopo.py and bonus.py

Task advance topology connection extension

Open two terminals in Mac or PuTTy in Windows and connects to the Virtual BOX.

Use command: “$ sudo mn -c” and command “$ sudo killall controller” to clean all topos and 
controller are running.

The bonusTopo should be put in directory ~/mininet

Then use command: "$ sudo mn --custom bonusTopo.py --topo mytopo" to 
build up a topology which has three hosts, a switch and a controller.

The topology is similar to topo in Task 2, but more hosts.

The bonus.py should be put in the directory ~mininet/pox/ext

When topology has been successfully built up, to run the controller, use conmmand
 “$ ./pox.py bonus”

If you want to see the debug information use command: "$ ./pox.py log.level --DEBUG bonus"

To see if the connection is established, use "mininet> pingall". and it will return the result of
ping. 

To see ICMP work, use "mininet> (any host) ping -c1 (an IP address not show up in topo and controller)"

Router is pingable, use "mininet> (any host) ping -c1 (an IP address connects to the host in router)"

To evaluate the network porformance use "mininet> iperf".

Code discription:
	
	The function and data structure is similar to part 1 task 2, besides there is new class called router2 and 
	router3. They are the classes which contain the routetable and port IP address of s2 and s3(the objects of router2
	and router3)
